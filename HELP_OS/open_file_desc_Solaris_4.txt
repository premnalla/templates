All releases allow for much more than 1024; it's not tested to a great 
extend nor is it efficient in older releases.  Solaris 8 is the first 
release to efficiently deal with large numbers of fds.  Solaris 7 is 
the first release to allow more than 1024 fds for select. 
(Opening a million fds with proper limits set is certainly possible) 

Solaris 7 is also the first release containing the "plimit" program 
which allows you to query and set the per-process limits for any process. 


Solaris 2.3 and before are extremely inefficient in handling large 
numbers of fds. 


The solaris FAQ says: 


3.45) How can I increase the number of file descriptors per process? 


    In 2.3 in earlier this requires poking the kernel. 
    In Solaris 2.4+, this can be accomplished by adding the 
    following lines to /etc/system: 


        * set hard limit on file descriptors 
        set rlim_fd_max = 4096 
        * set soft limit on file descriptors 
        set rlim_fd_cur = 1024 


    Raising the soft limit past 256 may confuse certain applications, 
    especially BCP applications.  Raising the limit past 1024 may 
    confuse applications that use select().  Select() cannot use more 
    than 1024 file descriptors at this time prior to Solaris 7.  In 
    Solaris 2.6, the RPC code was rewritten to use poll(), which does 
    work with many more fds than select().  Prior to 2.6, all RPC 
    servers will likely crash and burn if you increase the fd soft 
    limit past 1024. 


    Solaris 7 allows upto 65536 fds passed to select; this is the 
    default for 64 bit applications but it requires recompiling with a 
    larger value for FD_SETSIZE for 32 bit apps. 


    Programs using stdio or even library calls that use stdio may break 
    when they have more than 256 files open as that is the stdio limit. 
    Programs using many filedescriptors should try and reserve a number 
    of low numbered file descriptors for use by stdio. 


    The stdio limit is removed for 64 bit applications in Solaris 7; 
    if you really need more than 256 FILE * in and you can't use Solaris 7+ 
    or need to run in 32 bits, you can use SFIO from AT&T.
